## Features

* <a target="_blank" href="https://wso2-extensions.github.io/siddhi-io-email/api/1.0.12/#email-sink">email</a> *(<a target="_blank" href="https://wso2.github.io/siddhi/documentation/siddhi-4.0/#sink">(Sink)</a>)*<br><div style="padding-left: 1em;"><p>The email sink uses 'smtp' server to publish events via emails. It can be published events in 'text', 'xml' or 'json' formats. The user can define email sink parameters in either 'deployment yaml' file or stream definition. So that email source checks whether parameters are given in stream definition or 'ymal' file respectively. If it is not given in both places, then default values are taken for the optional parameters. If user need to configure server system parameters which are not given as options in stream definition then it is needed to define them in 'yaml' file under email sink properties. (Refer link: https://javaee.github.io/javamail/SMTP-Transport to more information about smtp server parameters). Further, some email account required to enable 'access to less secure apps' option (for gmail account you can enable it via https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps).</p></div>
